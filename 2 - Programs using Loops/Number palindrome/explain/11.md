Sure! Let’s walk through the logic step-by-step using **long division** with the input **11**.

---

### 🔹 What the code does?

It checks whether the given number is a **palindrome** (same when reversed).

The process:

1. Extract each digit from the rightmost side.
2. Build the reversed number using that digit.
3. Finally compare the original number with the reversed number.

### 🔸 Input

```
Enter a number: 11
```

So,

```
temp = 11
sum = 0
num = 11
```

## 🔹 Long Division Logic Breakdown

### ➤ **First iteration**

```
num = 11
r = num % 10 → 11 % 10 = 1  (last digit)
num = num / 10 → 11 / 10 = 1  (integer division)

sum = sum * 10 + r
    = 0 * 10 + 1
    = 1
```

🧮 Result so far:

```
sum = 1
num = 1
```

---

### ➤ **Second iteration**

```
num = 1
r = num % 10 → 1 % 10 = 1
num = num / 10 → 1 / 10 = 0  (integer division)

sum = sum * 10 + r
    = 1 * 10 + 1
    = 11
```

🧮 Result now:

```
sum = 11
num = 0  → loop stops
```

---

## 🔹 Final Check

Compare original number `temp` with reversed `sum`:

```
temp = 11
sum = 11
```

✔ They are equal → **11 is a palindrome**

---

### 📝 Final Output

```
11 is a palindrome
```

If you'd like, I can also show a trace table for different inputs like 121, 12321, 123 etc. Would you like that?
